# Exercise 7 – Some Counting

This exercise demonstrates the use of for loops to count in different ranges and increments.

## Requirements
- Count from 0 to 50 (increment 1)
- Count from 50 to 0 (decrement 1)
- Count from 30 to 50 (increment 1)
- Count from 50 to 10 (decrement 2)
- Count from 100 to 200 (increment 5)
